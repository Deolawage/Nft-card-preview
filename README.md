### What I learned

I have learned how to use css methodologies.
I have learned how to be creative and confident.
I have also learned how to make an image align with a text
```html
       <p class="bottom-items"><img src="Image/image-avatar.png" alt="Avatar" align="center" width="48px" height="48px">   <em class="bottom-text last-word"><span id="creat">Creation of</span> <span  class="jules wyvern">Jules Wyvern</span></em></p>
  ```
  ```css
  .bottom img{
  border-radius:50px; 
  border:3px solid hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  margin-right:30px
  }
  ```
  I have learned how to overlay text and color on an image.
  ```html
      <div class="Equilibrium-img" id="image">
        <img src="Image/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="Equilibrium image" width="500px" height="500px"/>
      </div>
  ```
  ```css
  .Equilibrium-img:hover {
    
    top:50%;
    left:50%;
    background:url(Image/icon-view.svg) center  no-repeat;
      background-color:hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
     background-size:100px;
  
  }
  
  .Equilibrium-img img:hover {
    cursor:pointer;
    overflow: hidden;
    color:hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
    object-fit: cover;
  transition:0.3s;
    opacity:.3;
  
  }
```

### Useful resources


-Learn HTML and CSS with w3schools by Hege Refsnes, Ståle Refsnes, Kai Jim Refsnes, Jan Egil Refsnes with C. Michael Woodward.- This is an amazing book which helped me finally understand Html and Css. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
-Learning Web Design by Jennifer Niederst Robbins - This helped me to understand the concept of color overlay on an image, I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
